Project:  Time Search

Purpose:
This utility acts as a quick search to find changes quickly.  This is to allow the most function with the least typing.

Features:
- The script name is the time unit.  All that is required is a symbolic link to the main program, and it will be the time unit to use.
Example:  
* hours 6 : would search for everything 6 hours or newer
* days 2 : would search for everything 2 days or newer


- File Type Filtering:  What if you could specify the types of files you want to search for? Like, maybe you only want to see text files that have been modified, so you could add a flag like -t txt or something similar.
* -t text file (using the file command to quickly determine the file type)
* -img or -image
* -audio or -video
* -doc
